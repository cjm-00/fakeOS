## MVP:

### HTML/SCSS

- Wallpaper scales to fit the viewport
- Minimum 1 icons on desktop
- The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
- "App" looks consistent
- Menu contains a flex with content inside it
- "App" should use an external API

### JavaScript

- Put your js code into separate files
- Your icons and menu should add event listener for the click event, don't use the html onclick attribute
- Give your functions and variables good names
- Use the arrow syntax to declare functions

### Github

- Create a repo on github with a README
- Clone Repo
- Create and checkout develop branch
- Push all changes to your develop branch
- When submitting create a pull request from develop into main for review
- Add coach as a reviewer
